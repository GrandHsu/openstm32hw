Orone-mini designs

Orone-mini's are designed to be software and mostly hardware compatible with LeafLabs Maple-mini. Some improvements have been inspired by Siy's mini48.

The focus for Orone-mini is improving Maple-mini:
1. DIY-assemblable
2. Robust operation above 6V while providing current to e.g. LEDs and electronics
3. USB Electro-static Discharge (ESD) protecting the Host PC and Orone-mini
4. Socket for easier-to-connect external power
5. Power-on indicator
