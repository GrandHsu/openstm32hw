Mini48U is a STM32 development board for OpenSTM32 project (https://github.com/gbulmer/openstm32).
This design is significantly modified Maple Mini R2 and further development of Mini48 
with some changes in schematic (no separate analog ground, added RTC crystal comparing to Maple Mini
and differently connecter RESET pull up resistor) and reworked Mini48 PCB for 0.6" row header spacing.

Features:

- Compatible with Maple Mini, although ADC noise characteristics might be worse
- RTC crystal on board

The design files were created in Eagle 5.11.
